# US Citizenship Study Cards App

Trying to study for the US citizenship test?\
The Study Cards App puts all 100 official USCIS citizenship test questions on notecards!\

Version 1.1.0 added a new study mode: vocabulary from the N-400 application. This vocabulary is a key component to the communication test during the interview for citizenship. 

Download the app from the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/us-citizenship-study-cards/id1640996490)

Study everywhere you go!
* Tap cards to flip from front to back!
* Study a few cards against a time limit, or review all questions without a time limit!
* Throw the card with a swipe: right if you knew the answer, left if not!
* Focus on a particular topic or section, or pull questions randomly!
* Choose an app background from one of the US National Parks!

The official USCIS questions are available in English, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.
