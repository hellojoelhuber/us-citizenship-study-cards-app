Study everywhere you go!
* Tap cards to flip from front to back!
* Study a few cards against a time limit, or review all 100 questions without a time limit!
* Throw the card with a swipe: right if you knew the answer, left if not!
* Focus on a particular topic or section, or pull questions randomly!
* Choose an app background from one of the US National Parks!

The official USCIS questions are available in English, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese.
